<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta is the largest estuary on the west coast and the heart of California. The health and well-being of the Delta ecosystem and residents are deeply intertwined. The Delta Residents Survey research project was launched in 2023 by a collaborative group of university partners and California state agencies (California Sea Grant, University of California Davis, University of California Berkeley, Sacramento State University, Oregon State University, and the Delta Stewardship Council) as an effort to measure the well-being of Delta residents and understand how Delta communities are changing over time in response to regional social and environmental changes.</p>

<h2>Who was surveyed?</h2>

<p>Invitations to participate in the survey were mailed out to 82,000 households in the rural, suburban and urban Delta in early 2023. The survey was available in English and Spanish, and open for response online or on-paper for approximately 3 months. We received over 2,200 usable survey responses (~3% response rate), from diverse residents across the Delta. Survey results are representative of the full Delta population, with a margin of error of 2.1%.</p>

<h2>What was the survey about?</h2>

<p>The Delta Residents Survey focused on understanding the well-being of the region’s diverse residents. The survey was organized into four sections, focused on measuring: residents’ sense of place, quality of life, experiences with environmental and climate change impacts, and civic engagement and good governance. Each of these sections included sub-topics, as shown in the graphic. </p>
