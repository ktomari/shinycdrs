<p>The Delta Residents Survey (DRS) was a community survey conducted in the first quarter of 2023, reaching over 2,300 Delta and Delta-adjacent residents of the California Delta. The DRS had four substantive research aims:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Characterize residents’ sense of place;</li>
  <li>Assess well-being of a diverse and evolving population living in the region;</li>
  <li>Understand residents’ experiences and perceptions of environmental and climate changes across the estuary;</li>
  <li>Evaluate residents’ civic engagement and perceptions of governance in the region.</li>
</ol>
